==================================================================================

With the exception of Week 1 and Week 9 (the first and last weeks of the course), students will be presented with a new design assignment to be completed along with each daily lab.

The intent is that by the end of the course, students will have a complete "scalable" design that can be used as a solid starting point for any web project, as well as a stable of React components that can both integrate into the overall design, or stand alone.

Think [Material Design](https://material-ui.com) vs [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/)

**Students will create a new repository (or sandbox) to complete each assignment, building upon the others to complete one final product.**
